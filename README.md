**Quiz Bot using Langchain and Next.js**

**Description:**

The creation of a chatbot intended to provide people with quizzes is often referred to 
as a "Quiz Bot" project. Numerous platforms, websites, messaging applications, and 
social media sites, can incorporate these quiz bots. They are frequently employed for 
entertainment, education, or even consumer interaction and marketing in enterprises. 
These initiatives can be used for a variety of things, from educational apps that help 
students prepare for exams to marketing tools that engage clients with fun quizzes. 
Depending on the project's particular objectives and target audience, a Quiz Bot's 
implementation may differ.

The Network Security Quiz Bot project is to develop a chatbot that can generate 
network security quiz questions, offering different questions like multiple-choice, 
true/false, open-ended, and running locally to ensure data privacy. This report outlines 
the project's objectives, methods, and outcomes
